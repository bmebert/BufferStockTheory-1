  abstract = "Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively
              parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this
              variation at the whole-genome scale1-3. Here we report the
              integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their
              matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the
              Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the
              International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG
              resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute
              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and
              show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to
              critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect
              patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations,
              structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection
              of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding
              mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4;
              identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base
              substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural
              variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7;
              describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic
              mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and
              promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized
              features of cancer genomes8,10-18.",

  abstract = "The major hurdle for cancer vaccines to be effective is posed by
              tumor immune evasion. Several common immune mechanisms and
              mediators are exploited by tumors to avoid immune destruction. In
              an attempt to shed more light on the immunosuppressive
              environment in uterine tumors, we analyzed the presence of PD-L1,
              PDL2, B7-H4, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), galectin- 1,
              galectin-3, arginase-1 activity and myeloid-derived suppressor
              cell (MDSC) infiltration. IDO, PD-L1, PD-L2 and B7-H4 were
              analyzed by immunohistochemistry. PDL2 was mostly expressed at
              low levels in these tumors. We found high IDO expression in 21 \%
              of endometrial carcinoma samples and in 14 \% of uterine sarcoma
              samples. For PD-L1 and B7-H4, we found high expression in 92 and
              90 \% of endometrial cancers, respectively, and in 100 and 92 \%
              of the sarcomas. Galectin-1 and 3 were analyzed in tissue lysates
              by ELISA, but we did not find an increase in both molecules in
              tumor lysates compared with benign tissues. We detected
              expression of galectin-3 by fibroblasts, immune cells and tumor
              cells in single-cell tumor suspensions. In addition, we noted a
              highly significant increase in arginase-1 activity in endometrial
              carcinomas compared with normal endometria, which was not the
              case for uterine sarcomas. Finally, we could demonstrate MDSC
              infiltration in fresh tumor suspensions from uterine tumors.
              These results indicate that the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and B7-H4
              could be possible targets for immune intervention in uterine
              cancer patients as well as mediation of MDSC function. These
              observations are another step toward the implementation of
              inhibitors of immunosuppression in the treatment of uterine
              cancer patients.",

  author   = "Souto, Juan Carlos and Vila, Luis and Br{\'u}, Antonio",
  abstract = "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are the most abundant
              circulating immune cells and represent the first line of immune
              defense against infection. This review of the biomedical
              literature of the last 40 years shows that they also have a
              powerful antitumoral effect under certain circumstances.
              Typically, the microenvironment surrounding a solid tumor
              possesses many of the characteristics of chronic inflammation, a
              condition considered very favorable for tumor growth and spread.
              However, there are many circumstances that shift the chronic
              inflammatory state toward an acute inflammatory response around a
              tumor. This shift seems to convert PMN into very efficient
              anticancer effector cells. Clinical reports of unexpected
              antitumoral effects linked to the prolonged use of granulocyte
              colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates an intense and
              sustained neutrophilia, suggest that an easy way to fight solid
              tumors would be to encourage the development of intense
              peritumoral PMN infiltrates. Specifically designed clinical
              trials are urgently needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
              such drug-induced neutrophilia in patients with solid tumors.
              This antitumoral role of neutrophils may provide new avenues for
              the clinical treatment of cancer.",

  abstract = "Endometrial cancer is rising in prevalence. The standard
              treatment modality of hysterectomy is becoming increasingly
              inadequate due primarily to the direct link between endometrial
              cancer and high BMI which increases surgical risks. This is an
              immunogenic cancer, with unique molecular subtypes associated
              with differential immune infiltration. Despite the immunogenicity
              of endometrial cancer, there is limited pre-clinical and clinical
              evidence of the function of immune cells in both the normal and
              cancerous endometrium. Immune checkpoint inhibitors for
              endometrial cancer are the most well studied type of immune
              therapy but these are not currently used as standard-of-care and
              importantly, they represent only one method of immune
              manipulation. There is limited evidence regarding the use of
              other immunotherapies as surgical adjuvants or alternatives.
              Levonorgestrel-loaded intra-uterine systems can also be effective
              for early-stage disease, but with varying success. There is
              currently no known reason as to what predisposes some patients to
              respond while others do not. As hormones can directly influence
              immune cell function, it is worth investigating the immune
              compartment in this context. This review assesses the
              immunological components of the endometrium and describes how the
              immune microenvironment changes with hormones, obesity, and in
              progression to malignancy. It also describes the importance of

              and non-specific molecular profile (NSMP) are TCGA-defined
              molecular subgroups of endometrial cancer (EC). Hypothesizing
              that morphology and tumor immunology might differ depending on
              molecular background concerning composition and prognostic
              impact, we aimed to comprehensively interconnect morphologic,
              immunologic and molecular data. METHODS: TCGA-defined molecular
              groups were determined by immunohistochemistry and sequencing in
              n = 142 endometrioid EC. WHO-defined histopathological grading
              was performed. The immunologic microenvironment (iTME) was
              characterised by the quantification of intraepithelial and
              stromal populations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL:
              overall T-cells; T-Killer cells; regulatory T-cells (Treg)).
              Immunologic parameters were correlated with WHO-grading,
              TCGA-subgroups and prognosis. RESULTS: High density TIL were
              significantly more frequent in high-grade (G3) compared to
              low-grade (G1/2) EC in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of
              POLE-wildtype-/microsatellite-stable-EC. MSI was associated with
              high-level TIL-infiltration when taking into account the type of
              mismatch repair defect (MLH1/PMS2; MSH2/MSH6). Prognostic impact
              of biomarkers depended on molecular subgroups: In p53-mutant EC,
              Treg were independently prognostic, in NSMP, the unique
              independently prognostic biomarker was WHO-grading. CONCLUSIONS:
              EC morphology and immunology differ depending on genetics. Our
              study delineated two molecularly distinct subgroups of
              immunogenic EC characterized by high-density TIL-infiltration:
              MSI EC and high-grade POLE-wildtype/microsatellite-stable-EC.
              Prognostic impact of TIL-populations relied on TCGA-subgroups
              indicating specific roles for TIL depending on molecular

              myeloid cells (IMC) differentiate into granulocytes, macrophages
              and dendritic cells (DCs). This differentiation is impaired under
              chronic inflammatory conditions, which are typical for tumour
              progression, leading to the accumulation of IMCs. These cells are
              capable of inducing strong immunosuppressive effects through the
              expression of various cytokines and immune regulatory molecules,
              inhibition of lymphocyte homing, stimulation of other
              immunosuppressive cells, depletion of metabolites critical for T
              cell functions, expression of ectoenzymes regulating adenosine
              metabolism, and the production of reactive species. IMCs are
              therefore designated as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
              and have been shown to accumulate in tumour-bearing mice and
              cancer patients. MDSCs are considered to be a strong contributor
              to the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and thus an
              obstacle for many cancer immunotherapies. Consequently, numerous
              studies are focused on the characterisation of MDSC origin and
              their relationship to other myeloid cell populations, their
              immunosuppressive capacity, and possible ways to inhibit MDSC
              function with different approaches being evaluated in clinical
              trials. This review analyses the current state of knowledge on
              the origin and function of MDSCs in cancer, with a special
              emphasis on the immunosuppressive pathways pursued by MDSCs to
              inhibit T cell functions, resulting in tumour progression. In

              benefits of MDSC targeting in cancer.",

              novo, ovarian epithelial cancers are primarily imported from
              either endometrial or fallopian tube epithelium. The prevailing
              paradigm in the genesis of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC),
              the most common ovarian cancer, posits to its development in
              fallopian tubes through stepwise tumor progression. Recent
              progress has been made not only in gathering terabytes of omics
              data but also in detailing the histologic-molecular correlations
              required for looking into, and making sense of, the tissue origin
              of HGSC. This emerging paradigm is changing many facets of
              ovarian cancer research and routine gynecology practice. The
              precancerous landscape in fallopian tubes contains multiple
              concurrent precursor lesions, including serous tubal
              intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), with genetic heterogeneity
              providing a platform for HGSC evolution. Mathematical models
              imply that a prolonged time (decades) elapses from the
              development of a TP53 mutation, the earliest known molecular
              alteration, to an STIC, followed by a shorter span (6 years) for
              progression to an HGSC. Genetic predisposition accelerates the
              trajectory. This timeline may allow for the early diagnosis of
              HGSC and STIC, followed by intent-to-cure surgery. This review
              discusses the recent advances in this tubal paradigm and its
              biological and clinical implications, alongside the promise and
